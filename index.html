				<div class="heading-underline"></div>
				<p class="lead" style="color: floralwhite; text-shadow: .1rem .1rem .5rem white; margin-right: 5%; margin-left: 5%; text-align: left;">1.	To live longer: Who doesn’t love to live longer? Everybody does. And to do so, there’s no other option other than having a healthy lifestyle. A study shows that, people who maintain a healthy lifestyle (having a healthy diet, taking physical exercise, avoiding alcohol etc.)  can live up to 14 years more than those who don't maintain a healthy lifestyle! You surely would love to live more, right?<br><br>
2.	To thrive, not to survive: Let's be honest. Living to 100 years really isn't worth it if you are, at that age, bedridden or unable to enjoy your old life or unable to enjoy your time with your grandchildren. Cherish the life you have, enjoy every single moment. And to do so, stay healthy!<br><br>
3.	For gaining confidence: Those who work out regularly knows how good it feels after completing a long run, or doing 50 push ups, or completing all the sets of biceps workout properly. It gives a huge amount of confidence which surely will reflect on your other works of your daily life. Having a fit body, a healthy body can change your whole life, your attitude. Go for that!<br><br>
4.	To have a better mental health: A study conducted by researchers of Duke University shows that exercising for 30 minutes 3 times a week can help an estimated 60% of patients overcome their depression without taking any anti-depressant medication. We have been hearing from our very childhood that – a sound mind in a sound body! So who doesn’t want to have a sound and better mental health?<br><br>
5.	Avoiding illness and keeping medical cost down: Having a good lifestyle (having good food and taking exercise) can reduce free radicals as well as promote the release of toxins associated with diseases and illness. So, a good health will allow you to be disease free. In addition, this whole thing will help you to keep your medical costs down. Because if you are not healthy, you will catch diseases. And if you catch diseases, you will have to go to hospital and take medical assistance which will cost you money. So, in order to avoid all these, stay healthy!<br><br></p>
